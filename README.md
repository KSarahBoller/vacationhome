## Data Limitations
No booking data. Also, because hosts can set their own availability there is no way to determine the amount of dates that were made available were booked. We can't distiguish between hosts who only use airbnb occasionaly, and those who consistently have their home listed. Estimations were made useing review data. 
No customer data. We can't create customer profiles. 
No personal host data other than their first name. We cannot create host profiles
Only 34 US cities.
## Data Ethics
No personal data is shared. All data is scraped from airbnb's public site.
